This repository contains my solutions to problems from **LeetCode**, **Codeforces**, and other competitive programming platforms. The primary objective of this repository is to document my journey of improving problem-solving skills and preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies.

## Objectives

- **Sharpen Problem-Solving Skills**: Solve a variety of problems to enhance algorithmic thinking and coding efficiency.
- **Track Progress**: Maintain a record of solved problems for future reference and improvement.
- **Prepare for Big Tech**: Build a strong foundation for technical interviews at leading tech companies.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── leetcode/       # Solutions to LeetCode problems
├── codeforces/     # Solutions to Codeforces problems
├── others/         # Solutions from other platforms (e.g., HackerRank, AtCoder)
└── README.md       # This file
```

Each folder contains subdirectories or files categorized by problem difficulty or contest name.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the respective folder (e.g., `leetcode/` or `codeforces/`).
2. Open the file corresponding to the problem you are interested in.
3. Each solution includes:
   - Problem description (if applicable)
   - Approach/algorithm used
   - Clean and well-commented code

## Tools & Languages

- **Languages**: Primarily written in **Java**.
- **Tools**: Neovim, Linux terminal, and Git for version control.

## Future Goals

- Solve at least 500 problems across platforms.
- Participate in regular contests to improve speed and accuracy.
- Focus on advanced topics like dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and system design.
